Bachelor thesis in Applied Mathematics and Statistics by Arvi Jonnarth and Mattias Bertolino spring 2017 at Uppsala University, Department of Mathematics.

Project description: The goal of this project is to investigate and implement methods capable of making decisions
within a decision process such as making moves in a game. The task is to find a statistical method
or algorithm which can make qualified guesses for the next move without the use of any heuristic
knowledge. In many real world applications, the full decision tree turns out to be either unknown
or too large to expand out. A statistical sampling algorithm based on Monte Carlo methods is
therefore motivated by the same premises as Monte Carlo methods used to evaluate volumes in
high dimensional spaces. The question we would like to address is how well a statistical algorithm,
without heuristic knowledge, performs.

Acknowledgement: Without the discussions held with Jordi-Lluis Figueras, our project mentor and supervisor, this
work would not have been close to what it is now.  We would therefore like to thank him for
his guidance and support. We would also like to thank Ulla Ahonen-Jonnarth for the valuable
feedback. All of your inputs have contributed considerably to this thesis.
